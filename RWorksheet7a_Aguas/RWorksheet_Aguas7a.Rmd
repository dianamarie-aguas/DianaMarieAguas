```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r, include=TRUE}
library(Hmisc)
library(pastecs)
library(readr)
library("AppliedPredictiveModeling")
library(xlsx)
```

1. Create a data frame for the table below 
```{r, include=TRUE}
Student <- seq(1:10)
Pre_test <- c(55,54,47,57,51,61,57,54,63,58)
Post_test <- c(61,60,56,63,56,63,59,56,62,61)

studDF <- data.frame(Student, Pre_test, Post_test)
studDF
```

a. Compute the descriptive statistics using different packages (Hmisc and pastecs).
 Write the codes and its result.
```{r, include=TRUE}
describe(studDF)
stat.desc(studDF)
```

2. The Department of Agriculture was studying the effects of several levels of a
fertilizer on the growth of a plant. For some analyses, it might be useful 
to convert the fertilizer levels to an ordered factor.
```{r, include=TRUE}
fertilizer <- c(10,10,10,20,20,50,10,20,10,50,20,50,20,10)
```

a. Write the codes and describe the result.
```{r, include=TRUE}
agriculture <- sort(fertilizer, decreasing = FALSE)
agriculture
```

3. Abdul Hassan, president of Floor Coverings Unlimited, has asked you to study
the exercise levels undertaken by 10 subjects were “l”, “n”, “n”, “i”, “l” ,
“l”, “n”, “n”, “i”, “l” ; n=none, l=light, i=intense
```{r, include=TRUE}
unli <- c("l","n","n","i","l","l","n","n","i","l")
```

a. What is the best way to represent this in R?
# - Data frame
```{r, include=TRUE}
study <- data.frame(unli)
study 
```

4. Sample of 30 tax accountants from all the states and territories of Australia and
their individual state of origin is specified by a character vector of state mnemonics
as:
```{r, include=TRUE}
  state <- c("tas", "sa", "qld", "nsw", "nsw", "nt", "wa", "wa", "qld",
             "vic", "nsw", "vic", "qld", "qld", "sa", "tas", "sa", "nt",
             "wa", "vic", "qld", "nsw", "nsw", "wa", "sa", "act", "nsw",
             "vic", "vic", "act")
  state
```

a. Apply the factor function and factor level. Describe the results.
```{r, include=TRUE}
  fx3 <- factor(state)
  fx3
```

5. From 4 - continuation: • Suppose we have the incomes of the same tax
  accountants in another vector (insuitably large units of money)
```{r, include=TRUE}  
  incomes <- c(60, 49, 40, 61, 64, 60, 59, 54,
               62, 69, 70, 42, 56, 61, 61, 61, 58, 51, 48,
               65, 49, 49, 41, 48, 52, 46, 59, 46, 58, 43)
```  

a. Calculate the sample mean income for each state we can now use the special
function tapply():
```{r, include=TRUE}  
  revenue <- tapply(state, incomes, mean)
  revenue
```

b. Copy the results and interpret. 
```{r, include=TRUE}
  ###40 41 42 43 46 48 49 51 52 54 56 58 59 60 61 62 64 65 69 70 
  ###NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 
```

6. Calculate the standard errors of the state income means (refer again to number 3)
a. What is the standard error? Write the codes.
```{r, include=TRUE}  
  stdError <- function(x) sqrt(var(x)/length(x))
  stdError(study)
  incster <- tapply(incomes, state, stdError)
```  

b. Interpret the result.
# - It is not available due to character type variables that are in the data.
  
7. Use the titanic dataset.
```{r, include=TRUE}  
data("Titanic")

head <- data.frame(Titanic)
```

a. subset the titanic dataset of those who survived and not survived. Show the
codes and its result.
```{r, include=TRUE}
survivors <- subset(head, select = "Survived")
survivors
```

8. The data sets are about the breast cancer Wisconsin. The samples arrive periodically
as Dr. Wolberg reports his clinical cases. The database therefore reflects this
chronological grouping of the data. You can create this dataset in Microsoft Excel.

a. describe what is the dataset all about.
# - The data is about breast cancer in Wisconsin. The dataset contains the sample
# - of reports from Dr. Wolberg's clinical cases.

b.Import the data from MS Excel. Copy the codes.
```{r, include=TRUE}
library("readxl")

df <-read_csv("BreastCancer.csv")
df
```

c. Compute the descriptive statistics using different packages. Find the values of:
c.1 Standard error of the mean for clump thickness.
```{r, include=TRUE}
thick <- length(df$`CL. thickness`)
thic1 <- sd(df$`CL. thickness`)
thic2 <- thic1/sqrt(df$`CL. thickness`)
thic2
```

c.2 Coefficient of variability for Marginal Adhesion.
```{r, include=TRUE}
variants <- sd(df$`Marg. Adhesion`) / mean(df$`Marg. Adhesion`)* 100
variants
```

c.3 Number of null values of Bare Nuclei.
```{r, include=TRUE}
nuclei <- subset(df,`Bare. Nuclei` == "NA")
nuclei
```

c.4 Mean and standard deviation for Bland Chromatin
```{r, include=TRUE}
mean(df$`Bl. Cromatin`)
sd(df$`Bl. Cromatin`)
```

c.5 Confidence interval of the mean for Uniformity of Cell Shape
```{r, include=TRUE}
uni <- mean(df$`Cell Shape`)
uni
```

Calculate the standard error of the mean
```{r, include=TRUE}
standardE <- length(df$`Cell Shape`)
standardE1 <- sd(df$`Cell Shape`)
standardE2 <- standardE1/sqrt(standardE)
standardE2
```

Find the t-score that corresponds to the confidence level
```{r, include=TRUE}
tscore = 0.05
tsc = standardE1 - 1
confi = qt(p = tscore/ 2, df = tsc,lower.tail = F)
confi
```

Constructing the confidence interval
```{r, include=TRUE}
confiE <- confi * standardE2
```

Lower & Upper
```{r, include=TRUE}
low <- uni - confiE
```

```{r, include=TRUE}
up <- uni + confiE

LowUp <- c(low, up)
```

d. How many attributes?
```{r, include=TRUE}
attri <- attributes(df)
attri
```

e. Find the percentage of respondents who are malignant. Interpret the results.
```{r, include=TRUE}
perce <- subset(df, Class == "malignant")
perce
```
# - In 49 respondents, there are 18 that are malignant.
```{r, include=TRUE}
malig <- 17  / 49 * 100
malig
```

9. Export the data abalone to the Microsoft excel file. Copy the codes.
```{r, include=TRUE}
data("abalone")
#View(abalone)
head(abalone)
summary(abalone)
```

Export abalone
```{r, include=TRUE}
install.packages("xlsxjars")
library(xlsx)

write.xlsx(abalone, "abalone.xlsx")
```
